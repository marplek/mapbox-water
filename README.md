# mapbox-water
This project modifies the Mapbox source code to enable the addition of a dynamic ground-hugging water layer. By customizing the Mapbox rendering engine, this implementation allows developers to create realistic water surfaces that conform to terrain elevation, complete with animation effects.
## Live Demo

Check out the [live demo](https://marplek.github.io/mapbox-water/) to see the water effect in action.
